Celsius Network – Case Study

Celsius Network LLC of Hoboken, NJ went from a dream to a business plan in the summer of 2017 and from a plan to an entity in March of 2018, completing its first ICO. By June, v1.0 of its mobile applications were released with the first yield being distributed in August. By May 2019, $1.2bn of coin collateralized loans have been distributed and their service reaching 100 different countries. Today, Celsius now employs over 200 people in 5 different countries with 884k customers, $8.2bn in loans, and $15.6tn in customer assets as deposits. Celsius’ slogan “Unbank yourself. Earn high. Borrow Low. Change the world.” seems far fetched until we understand the founder.[1]

Alex Mashinsky, has put a sizeable dent in the world with that very ethos and has successfully distrupted voice mail, VOIP, VM, public transport, and Celsius is positioned to bring this same success to disrupt legacy banking. Mashinsky currently holds 35 patents in the tech sector, has raised over $1bn, exited over $3bn, and is known as The Godfather of VOIP and pioneer of web-based exchanges.[2] 

The idea for creating Celsius network is a recycled idea that spawned VOIP. In 1994, a long-distance call cost $3/min and telecom systems cost millions and with a $10k PC server, calls could be made for free. Mashinsky took this idea, made it a reality, and today almost 4bn people use this technology. Seeing an opportunity within legacy banking, where clients deposit their savings while receiving no appreciable yield on doing so, the idea of Celsius of being a platform of services where fair interest, no fees, quick services, while returning lending profits normally held by banks back to the client. [10] Where a normal personal savings account will yield .01% and carry a monthly fee Celsius charges no fee and yield is 8.88% for USDC stablecoin and up to 17.78% on CEL, Celsius’ native coin, and is paid weekly. [4]

Celsius initially received $30m prior to their initial coin offering in 2018 and currently is funded through rehypothecating client assets delegated to the Celsius network and yield on collateralized loans. The balance sheet for Celsius’ custodial assets was $15.6bn as of June, 18 2021. [8]

Consumers demand the best product for the lowest price, the Romans figured this out thousands of years ago and Celsius’ plan is to challenge banks to provide a better product by leveraging the scalability, efficiency, and borderless nature of blockchain technology. The market cap for M2 money supply is $20tr USD[5], Celsius is world-wide, nearly 4bn people use smart phones, and every week millions of new users are entering the crypto space. Celsius, and competitors such as BlockFi, Aave, and Compound, are not only serving this growing segment but taking small bites out of legacy banking.  

Celsius has a 3-tier approach to clientele; HODL’rs looking to earn yield on coins they do not plan on selling, retail clients to use Celsius as a high yield demand deposit account to replace legacy banking, and to provide high yield custodial accounts & low yield lending for institutions. [1] 

Celsius is a DeFi platform built on the Ethereum network much like its competitors BlockFi, Aave, and Compound. Ethereum is currently the industry leader in DeFi applications while its competitors are currently lagging behind in this segment. Ethereum is expected to upgrade within the next year and its competitors also plan to launch upgrades to facilitate DEXs, smart contracts, DeFi projects, etc. [8]To date, only ThorChain has attempted to form a bridge to multiple blockchains for liquidity pooling and swaps and was immediately hacked. This space is changing rapidly as new ideas are implemented, vulnerabilities exploited, and the market looks for the best product. Currently, Celsius is the leader in their segment. [6]

The DeFi domain is growing rapidly as more fiat is flowing into the crypto-space. YoY, the crypto market has grown 5x with a peak of $2.4t before May’s crash[13]. The 4 Horsemen of DeFi, as described by Coin Bureau, are Compound, Aave, BlockFi, and Celsius. Compound and Aave are 100% decentralized and clients control their keys, the trade-off being lower yields and fewer cryptos one can earn passive income on. BlockFi and Celcius are centralized in that clients essentially lend their crypto to these platforms, along with their keys, with the trade off being higher passive income and a greater selection of coins one can earn on. [8]

The largest trend in the last few years is one of regulatory uncertainty and a financial wild-west. According to a recent interview on Laura Chin’s “Unchained” podcase, ShapeShift founder and former CEO Erik Voorhees noted that neither lawyers or regulators know which of the top 100 crypto coins is a currency or which is a security. [7] The Chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is a former MIT professor who taught blockchain has publicly stated that Bitcoin is a new asset class and a store of value at his confirmation hearing however has yet to give further clarification on others.[3,9] Regulatory guidelines will be necessary to forecast what platforms come, which go, and who or how to solve new problems or inefficiencies. 

The effect of DeFi platforms, as well as successes seen by companies such as Celsius, can best be seen in the planned upgrades for all the largest blockchain networks. Bitcoin, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and Algorand are all following Ethereum’s lead and implementing the necessary upgrades to accommodate DeFi projects, DEX platforms, smart contracts, and NFTs along with their core of payment transfers. The next 6-12 months will be exciting as these upgrades roll out and new projects hit the chain. [14]

When it comes to KPIs and measuring success, DeFi is the wild-west. Unlike legacy financial institutions, there are no SEC filings, quarterly reporting and voting rights are only given to holders of their native tokens, and there is no FDIC guarantees on deposits. What metrics are disclosed to the public are current assets/holdings to compare to the entire crypto market cap, compare to Ethereum’s market cap, and your own risk tolerance. As of this writing, Aave is the leader in DeFi market cap with $20.2bn followed by Compound with $16.5bn, Celsius at $15.6bn, and BlockFi at $15bn. Due to market fluctuations and the crypto mix of their portfolios, these figures can change by the minute. But of the Big 4, Celsius has shown the most rapid growth and is likely due to impressive financial products and easy to use web and smartphone applications. 

The glaring issue I see within DeFi is consumer education and lack of “normie” marketing targeted to those who are new to the crypto space and/or learned of it through an uninformed source. Unfortunately, our uniformed sources are often those who criticize the space the most. [12] My first recommendation is to form a coalition within the crypto community to stop using the word “currency” after crypto much in the same way Xerox would like everyone to stop calling photo copiers “Xerox machines”. My second recommendation, when it comes to DeFi marketing, is to simply show in an A-B format what a “rainy day” balance in a savings account looks like compared to the same amount earning yield in DeFi, and perhaps a typical 401k/IRA, in an easy calculator type format one would find on NerdWallet. Make seeing opportunity a visual experience, not a mathematical one. One only needs to visit a grocery store to understand many of us shop with our eyes. 

Implementing these simple concepts, along with a coalition of peers, will steer the narrative from the falsehoods often repeated on legacy media to gain greater retail adoption. What is best for the crypto market is best for Celsius, and what’s best for Celsius is best for the client. Creating wealth is not a zero-sum game, it is the byproduct of financial freedom. 

Due to planned upgrades in all major blockchains within the next year and regulatory uncertainty, I would not recommend additional technologies or services in the immediate future and to reevaluate the blockchain landscape after Ethereum’s upgrade has been completed. Due to past upgrades in both Bitcoin and Ethereum turning into hard-forks and the recent hacking attack on ThorChain, it would be unwise to roll out any new blockchain services until thorough audits can be performed on Ethereum 2.0.
